# IV-IX-Programming-Exercise
 Create programs using Java, Python, and C++ language for each of the following problems.


1. Lottery Number Generator
Design a program that generates a 7-digit lottery number. The program should have an Integer array with 7 elements. Write a loop that steps through the array, randomly generating a number in the range of 0 through 9 for each element. (Use the random function) Then write another loop that displays the contents of the array.

2. Search Benchmarks
Design an application that has an array of at least 20 integers. It should call a module that uses the sequential search algorithm to locate one of the values. The module should keep a count of the number of comparisons it makes until it finds the value. Then the program should call another module that uses the binary search algorithm to locate the same value. It should also keep a count of the number of comparisons it makes. Display these values on the screen.

3. Sorting Benchmarks 
Design an application that uses three identical arrays of at least 20 integers. 
Create modules that perform the bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort algorithms on an Integer array, such that each module keeps a count of the number of swaps it makes. It should call each module on a different array, and display the number of swaps made by each algorithm.
